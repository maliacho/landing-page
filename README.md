# Mini Project: Landing Page

## Description
The motive behind this project was to build a landing page using HTML and CSS in order to practice what I learned in my bootcamp while I search for a job! 

It is a single webpage that collects a visitor's contact information. It will have a header and footer, and image with a caption, and a contact form.
